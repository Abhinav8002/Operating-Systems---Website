                <p>
                  Mac OS X 10.0 (code named Cheetah) is the first major release and
                  version of macOS, Apple's desktop and server operating system.
                  Mac OS X 10.0 was a radical departure from the classic Mac OS and was Apple's long-awaited answer
                  for a next generation Macintosh operating system. It introduced a
                  brand new code base and had a new Unix-like core, Darwin, which features a new memory management system.

                  OS X Lion, also known as Mac OS X Lion, is the eighth major release of macOS,
                  Apple's desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers.
                  Apple did not initially announce any physical media distribution for Lion,
                  such as a set of CD-ROMs or a DVD-ROM as used for past releases.
                  Instead, the operating system was said to be available exclusively as a download from the
                  Mac App Store for US$29.99.

                  macOS High Sierra is the fourteenth major release of macOS,
                  Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers.
                  Like with Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion and El Capitan,
                  the name also alludes to its status as a refinement of its predecessor,
                  focused on performance improvements and technical updates rather than user features.
                  Among the apps with notable changes are Photos and Safari.
